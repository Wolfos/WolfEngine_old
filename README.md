Open source version is no longer maintained
==========
As I plan to sell WolfEngine, I have decided to no longer provide it as open source. The existing code will remain on Github but I will not be updating it. I expect a commercial beta to be available within a year.

I will be providing this version under the Apache license.


WolfEngine

A tile based 2D game engine


Engine is still very much in progress. Documentation is in the Github Wiki.

License

The game engine is currently open source but will go proprietary later. Use the current version as you wish.
